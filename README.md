#### Problem solving strategy:
* Figured out the technologies I can use for this assignment
* Finalized the data model for this library app
* Took every user story as a single point of action at a time, yet keeping the bigger picture in mind for all user-stories
* Created application structure and skeleton of all potential classes and methods - otherwise TDD is not possible
* TDD: Created test cases for the First user story and they were all failing at that point
* Started implementation and they started to pass one by one.
